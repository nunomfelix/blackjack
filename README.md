- An Ace can have a value of 1 or 11, depending on the player's preference and the current hand's total value.

## Features
- Interactive UI for playing Blackjack
- Backend service for handling game logic and scoring
- Simple and clean codebase
- Object-oriented design

- backend/ - Contains the backend service developed using Nest.js.
  - src/ - Contains the source code for the backend service.
    - controllers/ - Handles HTTP requests and interacts with the game logic.
    - services/ - Implements the game logic and scoring.
    - models/ - Defines the models used in the game.
    - app.module.ts - Configures the Nest.js application module.
